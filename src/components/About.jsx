            I'm 21 years old, I've always been passionate about technology. I
            worked with several things before joining the programming area. I
            was only able to start after training my technical education in IT.
            After that I joined paipe.co, the company that gave me my first
            opportunity as a front-end programmer. I started working with
            ReactJS and now I work with Next.Js using TypeScript as well. And in
            addition to the front end, I've been looking to learn the backend.
